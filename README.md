This is a simple simulator for the guild wars 2 mystic forge. For those unfamiliar with the game, the forge allows the player to place 4 items in returns one item with a guaranteed formula.

I was curious, so I sat down and wrote a program to try to see if it was accurate. It is not.

There is a specific craftable that can be made in the game for a paltry sum. I discovered years ago that it unintentionally only produces items worth around six to twenty times its value from the forge and essentially used it as a way to print money.

As it is a simple proof of concept, it is currently hardcoded in several ways. It serves its purpose, however. If you are willing to experiment ingame, you'll find different results than this offers.
